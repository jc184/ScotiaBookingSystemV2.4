# ScotiaBookingSystemV2.4
A Flight Booking System built using Java, with Unit Tests

This was a project that formed part of my BSc Computing (Software Development), DH3C 35 Object Oriented Programming module. It is an exercise that demonstrates the use of Unit Testing using JUnit and the use of JavaDocs. The project does not use a database and instead uses Object Persistence to simulate persistent data storage.
To try out the project, select files from the Test folder by right-clicking and choose 'Run File'.
